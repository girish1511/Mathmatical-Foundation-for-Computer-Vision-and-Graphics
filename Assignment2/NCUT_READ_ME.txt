-------------------Implementation of Normalized Cut Algorithm----------------

-Place all the MATLAB files in the same folder as the Dataset folder.

-Run the file norm_cut.m

-'norm_cut.m' contains the segments: reading image, calculating weight matrix and laplacian, partitioning and storing images.

-'min_ncut.m' returns the value of the degree of dissimilarity of between partitions called cut.

-'part.m' performs the partition for given weight matrix, node_data, ncut_thershold.
