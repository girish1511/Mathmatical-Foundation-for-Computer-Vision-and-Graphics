--------------Implementation of Simple Linear Iterative Clustering(SLIC)-----------------

-Place all the MATLAB files in the same folder as the Dataset folder.

-Run the file SLIC.m

-'SLIC.m' contains the segments: reading image, initialization of clusters, main algorithm and display of results

-'distance.m' is a user defined function that contains the code for the distance metric as mentioned in[1]

-5 images used for testing and results are stored in the 'SLIC_out' folder.
