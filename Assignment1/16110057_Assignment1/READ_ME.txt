----------------------Iterative Closest Point Algorithm----------------------

-Place all the MATLAB files the same folder as the Dataset folder.

-Run the file 'Assignment1.m'.

-'Assignment1.m' consists of three segments, namely: Dataset reading segment, processing segment and data writing segment.

-'corres.m' is a user-defined function that finds the correspondences between P_i and Q_i point clouds.

-'trans.m' is a user-defined function that finds the t and R for given correspondences.

-Q_ialigned, R_i, T_i consists of Q_i aligned with P_i, rotation matrix of ith point cloud and translation vector for ith point cloud, respectively.

-In the MATLAB program P, Q, Q_aligned, T, R all are stored in cells.
